# The-mandalorian
The mandalorian is a website i had to do for the end of my first year.

To try it on your computer, import the bdd wich is in the folder "sql" and change the line 6 in php/database.php :

    $pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mandalorian', 'root', '');
    
Change it so it link with your PDO
